        business as usual won’t stop the runaway effects of our warming planet. It’s time 
        to focus on solutions and design strategies that create products, materials, buildings,
         and systems that help all species thrive. Biomimicry — emulating nature’s patterns and 
         strategies to develop sustainable technologies — can help us get there.`
